## About

The Networking Demos repository provides practical examples and demonstrations for various networking protocols.

## UDP

> UDP is a connectionless protocol that is often used for real-time applications where low latency is crucial.

Here is some simple demo project to gain practical experience with UDP in Node.js:

- [UDP Server using nodejs](./udp-demos/simple-udp-server-using-nodejs/)
- [Sensor data streaming Demo](./udp-demos/sensor-data-streaming-demo/)

## TCP

> TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications.

Here is some simple demo project to gain practical experience with TCP in Node.js:

- [Simple TCP Server using nodejs](./tcp-demos/simple-tcp-server-using-nodejs/)
